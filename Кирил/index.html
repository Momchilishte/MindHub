    <p id="ivan">Mega Morph
        Highly experienced slugs can evolve into an even stronger form called a Mega Morph when shot at two hundred miles per hour. If a slug is not experienced enough, it will get thrown off by the intense speed and the Mega Morph will fail. The first time a slug transforms into a Mega Morph, its Protoform appearance permanently changes. By equipping a blaster with an accelerator, the slinger can help a slug Mega Morph more easily. The Shane Gang got the accelerator from Red Hook after Eli rescued Red Hook from Dr. Blakk's cultivation.</p>
